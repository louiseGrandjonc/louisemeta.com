![Alt text](/images/Owls_dance_03.png)My name is Louise, I am a web developer. I've been working as a lead python developer at [Ulule](https://ulule.com) for three years. Previously I worked at [peopledoc](https://www.people-doc.fr/) as a python developer. Before that I was a student at the [UTC (not the timezone)](https://www.utc.fr/). 

I am also working on a few sides projects, like a website for a [musician, drawer, architect](/projects/zim/), the [pgday paris website](/projects/pgday/) and a lot of unfinished experimentations (mostly for fun).

I love writing SQL, python, data modelisation, using emacs, solving tricky problems till my head hurts. My job also includes some management, dealing with technical debt, some html and jQuery... I am also a human so I like normal things like trying a billion different recipes for a cake, playing music, doing talks at conferences and meetups. I apparently enjoy very much spending hours preparing those and using funny owls drawings in my slides.
