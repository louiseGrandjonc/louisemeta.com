      <description>Stephan Zimmerli is an artist who has a tendancy to be brilliant in several fields: architecture, stage design, drawing, photography, music&amp;hellip; So when he came to me with the project of a website that would allow him to show his work, always in between this art forms, I was thrilled.
The website is still in construction, we are building what he calls a mnemotopy, an architecture, like a house, to visit twenty years of notebooks, music, and videos.</description>

      <description>About three years ago, I met Dimitri Fontaine at the fosdem. He asked me to work on the pgdayParis website. He knew I was a django developer and hoped that I would be good at CSS&amp;hellip;
But working on this, helped me get into this amazing community (mostly by drinking beers the day of the deployment), use heroku for the first time and made me want to do talks. So, hurray !</description>
