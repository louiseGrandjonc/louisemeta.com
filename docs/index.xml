      <description>Introduction If you don&amp;rsquo;t know EXPLAIN and are starting with this article, I really encourage you to start from the beginning, to understand better what a query plan is and how to use EXPLAIN. The previous article covers that.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to clarify the different types of scans used to filter tables and retrieve the exptected rows.
I&amp;rsquo;m here taking the example of a letter delivery system.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you didn&amp;rsquo;t read the articles on logs and pg_stat_statements this article is based on a talk that I did at the pgdayParis and here are the slides. The video should be online soon, you can watch the short version from the djangoConEurope 2017.
If you want to test the queries, here is the github project for the talk. You can find a dump of the database, and the SQL using generate_series to fill the DB.</description>

      <description>Introduction As a reminder, if you ended up on this page by looking up on bing pg_stat_statements, first I&amp;rsquo;m impressed, you get results with bing ? But also, this article is based on a talk that I did at the pgdayParis 2018 and here are the slides
What is pg_stat_statements ? pg_stat_statement is a postgreSQL extension, once you enable it, it tracks statistics on the queries executed by a server.</description>

      <description>Introduction A few years back, when I was an intern, the CTO asked me if I checked how many queries were executed on the page, turns out there were over a hundred&amp;hellip; I realized that I was missing some basics :
 Like a lot of web developers I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of looking into my logs to know what my ORM was doing Once I knew, I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why some queries were slow  After that I became a bit obsessed with performances and that&amp;rsquo;s the story of why I submitted a talk at the django con 2017, and then at the pgdayParis 2018.</description>

      <description>Stephan Zimmerli is an artist who has a tendancy to be brilliant in several fields: architecture, stage design, drawing, photography, music&amp;hellip; So when he came to me with the project of a website that would allow him to show his work, always in between this art forms, I was thrilled.
The website is still in construction, we are building what he calls a mnemotopy, an architecture, like a house, to visit twenty years of notebooks, music, and videos.</description>

      <description>About three years ago, I met Dimitri Fontaine at the fosdem. He asked me to work on the pgdayParis website. He knew I was a django developer and hoped that I would be good at CSS&amp;hellip;
But working on this, helped me get into this amazing community (mostly by drinking beers the day of the deployment), use heroku for the first time and made me want to do talks. So, hurray !</description>
